# PokedexAPI
Pokemon Pokedex API

## Installation / Running the project
To run this project please use Visual Studio 2019

## Docker
I only have experience running docker containers in a linux machine so i was unable to generate the docker file in the allotted time.

## Improvements
I've only covered a small percentage of the code with unit test so more unit test would be written for a production machine.
I'd also add a lot more logging in places, I've added the exception middleware but the logger hasn't been set up correctly.
I'd also add my comments to the code.
I would also run SQA against the code to ensure i haven't missed any potential quality issues
